# OpenCV-Face-Pose-Estimation-from-Landmarks

## Description

The following [repo](https://github.com/jerryhouuu/Face-Yaw-Roll-Pitch-from-Pose-Estimation-using-OpenCV) is outdated, so we upgraded the version a little more and made the preprocessing work easier by increasing usability.

``` python
python pose_estimation.py
```

## Configuration

(TBD)

## Defendencies

- Python 3.8.8
- opencv 4.5.2
